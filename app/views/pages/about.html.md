## What the heck is alonetone?

alonetone is a place for small label, DIY, bedroom and other musicians and bands to upload and share their mp3s for free.

We've been around since 2008.

If you make music (and own the rights to it) then this site is built for you.

## So, it's free?

Yup!

## Can I upload my podcast or radio show?

Sorry, no! Alonetone is for people who make music. If you upload other audio content  (podcasts, radio shows, sermons, audio books) it will be removed without warning.

## Can I upload songs for my blog?

No.  Alonetone is for individual artists uploading their own music. If you upload various artists or copyrighted content, it will be removed. Your account will be deleted if it happens more than once.


## Why alonetone instead of XYZ?

Most other 'free' services where you can host your music run ads, are funded by investors hoping to profit, or are flat out owned by media conglomerates. In general, they are hoping to make money off of your "content"...erm...music.

alonetone is a non-commercial alternative. Something that musicians can feel like they own.

Beyond that, we want to do it right. Clean, only the essentials. Not too dorked-out. Easy to get around. [Read more here](/about/why-i-built-alonetone).

## Can I sell my music here?

Nope!

alonetone is for people who want to give our music away and share it freely. There are many places where you can try and sell your tunes (see: [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com)).

## Who makes alonetone?

alonetone is conceived and built by [Sudara](/sudara).

[montgomeru](/montgomeru) handles frontend coding.

We get regular design love from Samo.

After our initial launch in 2008, most features were inspired, recommended by, and built to please alonetoners who spoke up and provided their valuable feedback in chat and the forums.

## Who pays for all of this? Are you a startup?

Sudara has historically paid for all hosting, storage, design and development costs.

In late 2020, we started a [patreon](http://patreon.com/alonetone) so these costs could be shared by the community. As of early 2021, server and storage costs are almost covered by other alonetoners.

## How long will it be free?

We strongly believe there should be more free, non-commercial places to share music online. Therefore, the ability to upload and share music without ads or payment will exist as long as alonetone exists.

You can help us realize this vision over on [patreon](http://patreon.com/alonetone)!

## Is alonetone open source?

Yup! We are open-minded to contributions at [github](http://github.com/sudara/alonetone).

Thanks to the nice people at [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) and [Skylight](https://skylight.io) for providing their services free for open source projects.
